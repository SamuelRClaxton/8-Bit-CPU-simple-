The task is as follows, the circuit should be a control system for an electronic car-park gate. The gate should open after £4 has been entered and can exclusively accept both £1 and £2 coins. once £4 is entered the gate should be opened. any change should be carried over to the next transaction and cancel can be entered at any time in order to return the current amount of change.

The task that I have set out to achieve in both simple logic and again with a simple 8 bit processor is as follows:

* It should take 3 separate inputs as buttons:
	* One of £1
	* One for £2
	* One for Cancel
* it should have 4 display outputs:
	* One to display the gate having opened
	* One each to display the return values (£1, £2, £3)
* The display should remain on until another input is entered
