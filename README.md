# 8 Bit CPU (simple)
This is a very basic 8 bit CPU that runs on a simple self defined assembly language (also included) and can run simple programs
The specification can be found in this repository along with one example rom that runs a program that simulates the actions of the gate circuit (also included). All .circ files run in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/ "Logisim") which is a logic gate simulation program with a few added features.
