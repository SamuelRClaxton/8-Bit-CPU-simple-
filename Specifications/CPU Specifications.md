CPU SPECIFICATIONS
-
---

 - The processor takes data then instruction
 - Harvard Architecture
	 - 256 bit program memory
	 - 16-256 bit RAM (variable memory)
		 - Dependent on replacement of RDI and STI with RDN and STN functions
 - 4 Bit instruction Set:
	 - 0 - NOP
		 - No Operation
			 - Does nothing for one clock cycle
	 - 1 - LDN
		 - Load Next
			 - Loads the next value to the working register
	 - 2 - LDI
		 - Load Immediate
			 - Loads the immediate value to the working register
	 - 3 - RDI
		 - Read Immediate
			 - Reads the contents of the address featured immediately to the working register
	 - 4 - STI
		 - Store Immediate
			 - Stores the current value in the working register in the address featured immediately
	 - 5 - ADDI
		 - Add Immediate
			 - Adds the immediate value to the value in the working register
	 - 6 - ADDN
		 - Add Next
			 - Adds the next value to the value in the working register
	 - 7 - JPZ
		 - Jump Zero
			 - Jumps to the next value as location if the value of the working register is zero
	 - 8 - JPC
		 - Jump Carry
			 - Jumps to the next value as location if the carry bit was raised in the previous operation
	 - 9 - ANDI
		 - AND Immediate
			 - Logically AND with the immediate value and the current value of the working register
	 - A - ANDN
		 - AND Next
			 - Logically AND with the next value and the current value of the working register
	 - B - ORI
		 - OR Immediate
			 - Logically OR with the immidiate value and the current value of the working register
	 - C - ORN
		 - OR Next
			 - Logically OR with the next value and the current value of the working register
	 - D - NOT
		 - Inverts the working Register
			 - Logically NOT the current value of the working register
	 - E - SLB
		 - Shift Left Bit
			 - Shifts the value left by one Bit and detects overflow
	 - F - SRB
		 - Shift Right Bit
			 - Shift the value right by one Bit , preseving sign if possible and detecting overflow
